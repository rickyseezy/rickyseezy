## 💡 **Projects Built from Scratch**

Each of these projects started from a blank repo — I handled the architecture, backend, frontend, and DevOps end-to-end.

### 🧠 Heex Technologies

**Problem:** The platform had severe scalability issues, high cloud costs, and unreliable infrastructure — blocking enterprise clients like Renault, SNCF, etc ...

**Solution:** I led the complete re-architecture: migrated from REST/NodeJS to GraphQL/Golang, replaced MariaDB with MongoDB, and built a fully cloud-native stack with Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and Terraform.

**Impact:** Achieved zero-downtime deployments, horizontally scalable APIs, and major performance gains while cutting operational costs.

**Stack:** Go • gRPC • GraphQL • MongoDB • Kubernetes • Terraform • ArgoCD • GitLab CI
